        <p style="text-indent:20px;">A trial attorney must understand the function of a jury, how juries arrive at conclusions, and the role that the jury plays in administering justice. Those who have suffered an injury should expect, and demand, an attorney who has the experience and proven track record to win over a jury. Johnson & Lee is a trial firm, and our attorneys have demonstrated their abilities and our firm’s persistence by the results they have achieved in court.</p>


<p>At Johnson & Lee, every case is meticulously prepared. However, preparation alone does not supplant trial skill. It is the combination of our attorneys’ skills and work ethic that has resulted in success, both in the courtroom and at the negotiating table, for this firm.</p>

<p>Throughout the years, our opponents have learned that if they are not prepared to meet our settlement demands, our attorneys are prepared to try the case in front of a jury. As a result, our clients’ settlements are much higher than they would be if we had not established the reputation of a firm that takes cases to trial. Ultimately, obtaining a favorable settlement for our clients is our duty, and obtaining a full settlement is what we pride ourselves on.</p>

<p>We also pride ourselves on our reputation in the legal community. It has been said that “success breeds success.” Fortunately for Johnson & Lee, the firm’s success has allowed it to attract and retain some of the most accomplished and competent trial lawyers in this field of law. The ability to build a law firm with such strong attorneys is truly exciting, as it allows us to continue to bring that great success to our clients.</p>

    	<p style="text-indent:20px;"> I have built my career on a strong foundation of hard work, dedication to client service and achievement of results. Upon graduation from Norwich University, a private military college in Vermont, I was commissioned an officer in the United States Navy. I served our country in this capacity for six years on active duty and fourteen years in the reserves.</p>

<p>Since joining Johnson & Lee, I have completely dedicated myself to the success of our firm and our clients. Because I believe that client service is one of the most important factors separating our firm from the others, I commit myself and all of my energies to every case I try. My personal strength is an inner drive and motivation to do right by the people who count the most: the clients I have been asked to serve.</p>

<p>I have 100 percent job satisfaction because I am part of a legal team that shares a common goal. We believe every injured person deserves the utmost care and professionalism in achieving a fair resolution to his or her case. No matter the magnitude of the injury, I treat every person I represent with dignity and respect. This type of treatment will not be forthcoming from the insurance companies, so I make it a hallmark of my service.</p>
